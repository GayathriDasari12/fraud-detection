# fraud credit card transaction detection

* The digital world has brought us some marvellous good effects, however, along with the good, it has brought some bad effects as well. In today's digital world, one huge negative effect it has brought is credit card fraud and ID theft. 
* In simple terms, credit card fraud is fraudulently done when somebody makes an unauthorized purchase using a stolen or misappropriated credit card (or card number).
*  We learn how we can detect such fradulent transaction in this project.
## technology
* machine learning with python
* anaconda3 
 ### how to use
 *  Because it is a classification problem of identifying whether a transaction is legal or fraud we choose logistic regression as our algorithm.
 *  We identify a transaction based on the class variable value.
 *  By looking on the data we get the idea that the class value 0 results a legal transaction.
 *  Based on this we find out whether a transaction is legal or not.
